## Project Structure

The project follows a clean and organized structure:

- **Main Application Class:** `InstagramBackendApplication.java` serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application.
- **Entities:** The application includes entities for `User`, `Post`, `Comment`, and `Like`, each with corresponding repository interfaces.
- **Security Configuration:** Spring Security is employed to secure the application with authentication and authorization.
- **Database Configuration:** The `application.properties` file configures the database connection and Spring Data JPA properties.
- **Controller Classes:** These classes define and document the RESTful API endpoints for user management, posts, comments, and likes.
- **Service Classes:** Business logic is implemented in service classes, ensuring separation of concerns.
- **Repository Interfaces:** Spring Data JPA repository interfaces manage data access to the underlying database.


## Data Flow

The Instagram Backend Application follows a structured data flow that encompasses user management, post creation, commenting, and liking. Here's an overview of how data flows through the application:

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**

    - Users start by registering accounts using their email and password.
    - The application securely stores user credentials.
    - Upon subsequent visits, users authenticate themselves using their registered credentials.
    - Spring Security manages user authentication and authorization.

2. **User Profile Management:**

    - Authenticated users can update their profiles, including usernames, profile pictures, and bios.
    - User profiles are stored as `User` entities in the database.

3. **Post Creation and Retrieval:**

    - Authenticated users can create posts, including images and captions.
    - Posts are stored as `Post` entities in the database.
    - Users can retrieve their own posts and posts from profiles they follow.
    - Public posts are accessible to all users.

4. **Commenting on Posts:**

    - Users can comment on posts created by themselves or others.
    - Comments are stored as `Comment` entities in the database.
    - Users can view comments associated with each post.

5. **Liking Posts:**

    - Users can like posts, indicating their appreciation.
    - Likes are stored as `Like` entities in the database.
    - Users can see the number of likes for each post.

6. **Security:**

    - Spring Security ensures secure access to user data and endpoints.
    - Passwords are securely hashed and stored.
    - Authentication tokens are generated and validated for secure API access.

7. **Data Persistence:**

    - User profiles, posts, comments, and likes are persisted in a relational database.
    - The application uses JPA (Java Persistence API) for database operations.
    - Entities are mapped to database tables for data storage.

8. **RESTful API Endpoints:**

    - The application exposes RESTful API endpoints to interact with user data, posts, comments and likes.
    - Each endpoint is documented and adheres to REST principles.



## RESTful API Endpoints

The application provides a wide range of RESTful API endpoints for social media functionalities:

### User Management

- **Register User:** `POST /api/users/register`
- **Login User:** `POST /api/users/login`
- **Get User Profile:** `GET /api/users/{userId}`

## Database Details

The Instagram Backend Application utilizes a MySQL database to persist user data, posts, comments, likes, and other relevant information. Here are the key details about the database:

- **Database Engine:** MySQL
- **Database Schema:** InstagramDB

### Schema Design

The application's database is designed with several tables to store various types of data:

1. **Users Table (`user`):**

    - Stores user profile information, including user ID, username, email, password, profile picture URL, and bio.
    - Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.

2. **Posts Table (`post`):**

    - Contains posts created by users, including post ID, user ID (foreign key), image URL, caption, and creation timestamp.
    - Handles the creation and retrieval of user posts.

3. **Comments Table (`comment`):**

    - Stores comments made on posts, with fields such as comment ID, user ID (foreign key), post ID (foreign key), comment text, and creation timestamp.
    - Manages the interaction between users on post comments.

4. **Likes Table (`like`):**

    - Records user likes on posts, including like ID, user ID (foreign key), post ID (foreign key), and creation timestamp.
    - Tracks user engagement and post popularity.

5. **Followers Table (`follower`):**

    - Manages user following relationships, with fields for follower ID (the user who follows) and followee ID (the user being followed).
    - Supports user interaction, such as viewing followed users' posts.

### Entity Relationships

The database tables are linked through foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity:

- The `user` table is referenced by the `post`, `comment`, and `like` tables to associate user data with posts, comments, and likes.
- The `follower` table establishes user-following relationships, allowing users to follow and view posts from other users.

This schema design ensures that user data, posts, comments, and likes are logically organized and can be efficiently queried for various application features.

### Database Configuration

The database connection properties are specified in the `application.properties` file, including the database URL, username, and password. Here is an example configuration for MySQL:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/InstagramDB
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

Make sure to replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your actual MySQL credentials.

The database schema (`InstagramDB`) is automatically created based on the entity mappings defined in the application. Hibernate, coupled with Spring Data JPA, handles the database schema generation and management.

Please note that the exact database configuration may vary based on your specific MySQL setup and requirements. Ensure that your MySQL server is running and accessible before launching the application.

## Data Structures Used

The project utilizes the following data structures:

### User Class

The `User` class defines the structure for user data and includes the following fields:

- `userId` (User ID): An integer that serves as a unique identifier for each user.
- `username` (Username): A string representing the user's username.
- `email` (Email): A string containing the user's email address.
- `profilePictureUrl` (Profile Picture URL): A string with the URL to the user's profile picture.

### Post Class

The `Post` class defines the structure for post data and includes the following fields:

- `postId` (Post ID): An integer that serves as a unique identifier for each post.
- `userId` (User ID): An integer indicating the user who created the post.
- `caption` (Caption): A text field representing the caption for the post.
- `imageUrl` (Image URL): A string with the URL to the post's image.

### Comment Class

The `Comment` class defines the structure for comment data and includes the following fields:

- `commentId` (Comment ID): An integer that serves as a unique identifier for each comment.
- `userId` (User ID): An integer indicating the user who created the comment.
- `postId` (Post ID): An integer indicating the post to which the comment belongs.
- `text` (Text): A text field representing the content of the comment.

### Like Class

The `Like` class defines the structure for like data and includes the following fields:

- `likeId` (Like ID): An integer that serves as a unique identifier for each like.
- `userId` (User ID): An integer indicating the user who created the like.
- `postId` (Post ID): An integer indicating the post to which the like belongs.

### ArrayList

The project utilizes the `ArrayList` data structure to manage lists of entities efficiently in various parts of the application. `ArrayList` provides dynamic sizing and efficient element retrieval, making it suitable for storing and processing user profiles, posts, comments, and likes.

These data structures enable the application to efficiently organize and manipulate user data while maintaining data integrity.
